		I&apos;m gonna need you to raise your glass
		<br />
		I don&apos;t care what you put in it
		<br />
		Here&apos;s to nights that you can&apos;t take back
		<br />
		We live hard but we love to laugh
		<br />
		<br />
		We all thought that we&apos;d get rich fast
		<br />
		Hop the plane out for greener grass
		<br />
		Found out the green is cash
		<br />
		Don&apos;t compare to the friends that last
		<br />
		<br />
		See, we won&apos;t forget where we came from
		<br />
		The city won&apos;t change us
		<br />
		We beat to the same drum
		<br />
		No, we won&apos;t forget where we came from
		<br />
		The city can&apos;t change us
		<br />
		We beat to the same drum, the same drum
		<br />
		<br />
		La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah
		<br />
		La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-doe
		<br />
		(Hey) And no matter where we go
		<br />
		We always find our way back home
		<br />
		<br />
		La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah
		<br />
		La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-doe
		<br />
		(Hey) And no matter where we go
		<br />
		We always find our way back home
		<br />
		<br />
		So here&apos;s to the cheap sunglasses
		<br />
		Red Bull and minivans and
		<br />
		People who had your back when
		<br />
		The world didn&apos;t understand
		<br />
		<br />
		See, we won&apos;t forget where we came from
		<br />
		The city won&apos;t change us
		<br />
		We beat to the same drum
		<br />
		No, we won&apos;t forget where we came from

		<br />
		(Hey) And no matter where we go
		<br />
		We always find our way back home
		<br />
		<br />
		La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah

		La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-doe
		<br />
		(Hey) And no matter where we go
		<br />
		We always find our way back home
		<br />
		<br />
		When ties loosen
		<br />
		We&apos;re losing touch
		<br />
		And fading away
		<br />
		We&apos;ll still be raising our cups
		<br />
		To the same damn things
		<br />
		<br />
		Oh no, the city won&apos;t change us
		<br />
		Oh no, the city won&apos;t change us
		<br />
		Oh no, the city won&apos;t change us
		<br />
		Oh no, the city won&apos;t change us
		<br />
		Won&apos;t change us
		<br />
		<br />
		La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah
		<br />
		La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-doe
		<br />
		And no matter where we go
		<br />
		We always find our way back home
		<br />
