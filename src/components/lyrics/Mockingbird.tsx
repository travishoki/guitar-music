    Hush, little baby, don&apos;t say a word.

    Papa&apos;s gonna buy you a mockingbird

		<br />
    Papa&apos;s gonna buy you a diamond ring

		<br />
    And if that diamond ring turns brass,

    Papa&apos;s gonna buy you a looking glass

    And if that looking glass gets broke,

    Papa&apos;s gonna buy you a billy goat
		<br />
		<br />
    And if that billy goat won&apos;t pull,
		<br />
    Papa&apos;s gonna buy you a cart and bull

		<br />
    And if that cart and bull turn over,

    Papa&apos;s gonna buy you a dog named Rover
		<br />
		<br />

    And if that horse and cart fall down,
		<br />
    You&apos;ll still be the sweetest little baby in town.
