		Oceans apart, day after day
		<br />
		And I slowly go insane
		<br />
		I hear your voice on the line
		<br />
		But it doesn&apos;t stop the pain
		<br />
		<br />
		If I see you next to never
		<br />
		How can we say forever?
		<br />
		<br />
		Wherever you go, whatever you do
		<br />
		I will be right here waiting for you
		<br />
		Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
		<br />
		I will be right here waiting for you
		<br />
		<br />
		I took for granted all the times
		<br />
		That I thought would last somehow
		<br />
		I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
		<br />
		But I can&apos;t get near you now
		<br />
		<br />
		Oh, can&apos;t you see it, baby?
		<br />
		You&apos;ve got me goin&apos; crazy
		<br />
		<br />
		Wherever you go, whatever you do
		<br />
		I will be right here waiting for you
		<br />
		Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
		<br />
		I will be right here waiting for you
		<br />
		<br />
		I wonder how we can survive
		<br />
		This romance
		<br />
		But in the end, if I&apos;m with you
		<br />
		I&apos;ll take the chance
		<br />
		<br />
		Oh, can&apos;t you see it, baby?
		<br />
		You&apos;ve got me goin&apos; crazy
		<br />
		<br />
		Wherever you go, whatever you do
		<br />
		I will be right here waiting for you
		<br />
		Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
		<br />
		I will be right here waiting for you
		<br />
		<br />
		Waiting for you
