    He is now to be among you at the calling of your hearts
    <br />
    Rest assured this troubadour is acting on his part
    <br />
    The union of your spirits here has caused him to remain
    <br />
    For whenever two or more of you are gathered in his name
    <br />
    There is love
    <br />
    There is love
    <br />
    <br />
    Well a man shall leave his mother and a woman leave her home
    <br />
    They shall travel on to where the two shall be as one
    <br />
    As it was in the beginning, is now until the end
    <br />
    Woman draws her life from man and gives it back again
    <br />
    And there is love
    <br />
    There is love
    <br />
    <br />
    Well then what&apos;s to be reason for becoming man and wife
    <br />
    Is it love that brings you here, or love that brings you life
    <br />
    For if loving is the answer, then who&apos;s the giving for?
    <br />
    Do you believe in something that you&apos;ve never seen before?
    <br />
    Oh, there&apos;s love
    <br />
    Oh there&apos;s love
    <br />
    <br />
    Oh the marriage of your spirits here has caused him to remain
    <br />
    For whenever two or more of you are gathered in his name
    <br />
    There is love
    <br />
    Ah there&apos;s love
