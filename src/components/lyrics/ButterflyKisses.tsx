		There&apos;s two things I know for sure
		<br />
		She was sent here from heaven
		<br />
		And she&apos;s daddy&apos;s little girl
		<br />
		As I drop to my knees by her bed at night
		<br />
		She talks to Jesus
		<br />
		And I close my eyes
		<br />
		And I thank God for all of the joy in my life
		<br />
		Oh, but most of all
		<br />
		<br />
		For butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer
		<br />
		Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair
		<br />
		&quot;Walk beside the pony, Daddy, it&apos;s my first ride&quot;
		<br />
		&quot;I know the cake looks funny, Daddy, but I sure tried&quot;
		<br />
		Oh, with all that I&apos;ve done wrong
		<br />
		I must have done something right
		<br />
		To deserve a hug every morning
		<br />
		And butterfly kisses at night
		<br />
		<br />
		Sweet 16 today
		<br />
		She&apos;s looking like her mama
		<br />
		A little more everyday
		<br />
		One part woman
		<br />
		The other part girl
		<br />
		To perfume and make-up
		<br />
		From ribbons and curls
		<br />
		Trying her wings out in a great big world
		<br />
		But I remember
		<br />
		<br />
		Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer
		<br />
		Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair
		<br />
		&quot;You know how much I love you, Daddy, but if you don&apos;t mind&quot;
		<br />
		&quot;I&apos;m only gonna kiss you on the cheek this time&quot;
		<br />
		Oh, with all that I&apos;ve done wrong
		<br />
		I must have done something right
		<br />
		To deserve her love every morning
		<br />
		And butterfly kisses at night
		<br />
		<br />
		All the precious time
		<br />
		Ooh
		<br />
		Like the wind, the years go by
		<br />
		Precious butterfly
		<br />
		Spread your wings and fly
		<br />
		<br />
		She&apos;ll change her name today
		<br />
		She&apos;ll make a promise
		<br />
		And I&apos;ll give her away
		<br />
		Standing in the bride-room
		<br />
		Just staring at her
		<br />
		She asked me what I&apos;m thinking
		<br />
		And I said, &quot;I&apos;m not sure&quot;
		<br />
		&quot;I just feel like I&apos;m losing my baby girl&quot;
		<br />
		And she leaned over
		<br />
		<br />
		Gave me butterfly kisses with her mama there
		<br />
		Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair
		<br />
		&quot;Walk me down the aisle, Daddy, it&apos;s just about time&quot;
		<br />
		&quot;Does my wedding gown look pretty, Daddy?&quot;
		<br />
		&quot;Daddy, don&apos;t cry&quot;
		<br />
		Oh, with all that I&apos;ve done wrong
		<br />
		I must have done something right
		<br />
		To deserve her love every morning
		<br />
		And butterfly kisses
		<br />
		<br />
		I couldn&apos;t ask God for more
		<br />
		Man, this is what love is
		<br />
		I know I gotta let her go
		<br />
		But I&apos;ll always remember
		<br />
		Every hug in the morning
		<br />
		And butterfly kisses
		<br />
