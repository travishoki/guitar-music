		Goin&apos; out tonight, changes into something red
		<br />
		Her mother doesn&apos;t like that kind of dress
		<br />
		Everything she never had she&apos;s showin&apos; off
		<br />
		Drivin&apos; too fast, moon is breakin&apos; through her hair
		<br />
		She&apos;s headin&apos; for somethin&apos; that she won&apos;t forget
		<br />
		Havin&apos; no regrets is all that she really wants
		<br />
		<br />
		We&apos;re only gettin&apos; older, baby
		<br />
		And I&apos;ve been thinkin&apos; about it lately
		<br />
		Does it ever drive you crazy
		<br />
		Just how fast the night changes?
		<br />
		Everything that you&apos;ve ever dreamed of
		<br />
		Disappearing when you wake up
		<br />
		But there&apos;s nothing to be afraid of
		<br />
		Even when the night changes
		<br />
		It will never change me and you
		<br />
		<br />
		Chasing it tonight, doubts are runnin&apos; &apos;round her head
		<br />
		He&apos;s waitin&apos;, hides behind a cigarette
		<br />
		Heart is beatin&apos; loud and she doesn&apos;t want it to stop
		<br />
		Movin&apos; too fast, moon is lightin&apos; up her skin
		<br />
		She&apos;s fallin&apos;, doesn&apos;t even know it yet
		<br />
		Havin&apos; no regrets is all that she really wants
		<br />
		<br />
		We&apos;re only gettin&apos; older, baby
		<br />
		And I&apos;ve been thinkin&apos; about it lately

		Goin&apos; out tonight, changes into something red
		<br />
		Her mother doesn&apos;t like that kind of dress
		<br />
		Reminds her of the missin&apos; piece of innocence she lost
