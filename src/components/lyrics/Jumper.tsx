		I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
		<br />
		You could cut ties with all the lies
		<br />
		That you&apos;ve been living in
		<br />
		And if you do not want to see me again
		<br />
		I would understand
		<br />
		I would understand
		<br />
		<br />
		The angry boy
		<br />
		A bit too insane
		<br />
		Icing over a secret pain
		<br />
		You know you don&apos;t belong
		<br />
		<br />
		You&apos;re the first to fight
		<br />
		You&apos;re way too loud
		<br />
		You&apos;re the flash of light on a burial shroud
		<br />
		I know something&apos;s wrong
		<br />
		Well, everyone I know has got a reason
		<br />
		To say
		<br />
		Put the past away
		<br />
		<br />

		I would understand
		<br />
		I would understand
		<br />
		<br />
		And well, he&apos;s on the table
		<br />
		And he&apos;s gone to code
		<br />
		And I do not think anyone knows
		<br />
		What they are doing here
		<br />
		<br />
		And your friends have left you
		<br />
		You&apos;ve been dismissed
		<br />
		I never thought it would come to this
		<br />
		And I<br />
		I want you to know
		<br />
		<br />
		Everyone&apos;s got to face down the demons
		<br />
		Maybe today
		<br />
		We can put the past away
		<br />
		<br />
		I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend

		I would understand
		<br />
		<br />
		I would understand
		<br />
		I would understand
		<br />
		Understand
		<br />
		<br />
		Can you put the past away?
		<br />
		I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
