    Hello darkness, my old friend
		<br />
    I&apos;ve come to talk with you again
		<br />
    Because a vision softly creeping
		<br />
    Left its seeds while I was sleeping
		<br />
    And the vision that was planted in my brain
		<br />
    Still remains
		<br />
    Within the sound of silence
		<br />
		<br />
    In restless dreams I walked alone
		<br />
    Narrow streets of cobblestone
		<br />
    ‘Neath the halo of a streetlamp
		<br />
    I turned my collar to the cold and damp
		<br />
    When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
		<br />
    That split the night
		<br />
    And touched the sound of silence
		<br />
		<br />
    And in the naked light I saw
		<br />
    Ten thousand people, maybe more
		<br />
    People talking without speaking
		<br />
    People hearing without listening
		<br />
    People writing songs that voices never share
		<br />
    No one dare
		<br />
    Disturb the sound of silence
		<br />
		<br />
    “Fools” said I, “You do not know
		<br />
    Silence like a cancer grows
		<br />
    Hear my words that I might teach you
		<br />
    Take my arms that I might reach you”
		<br />
    But my words like silent raindrops fell
		<br />
    And echoed in the wells of silence
		<br />
		<br />
    And the people bowed and prayed
		<br />
    To the neon god they made
		<br />
    And the sign flashed out its warning
		<br />
    In the words that it was forming
		<br />
    And the sign said “The words of the prophets
		<br />
    Are written on the subway walls
		<br />
    And tenement halls
		<br />
    And whispered in the sounds of silence”
