    When I first saw you, I saw love
		<br />
    And the first time you touched me, I felt love
		<br />
    And after all this time
		<br />
    You're still the one I love, mmm, yeah-yeah
		<br />
		<br />
    Looks like we made it
		<br />
    Look how far we've come, my baby
		<br />
    We mighta took the long way
		<br />
    We knew we'd get there someday
		<br />
		<br />
    They said, "I bet they'll never make it"
		<br />
    But just look at us holding on
		<br />
    We're still together, still going strong, mm
		<br />
		<br />
    You're still the one I run to
		<br />
    The one that I belong to
		<br />
    You're still the one I want for life
		<br />
    (You're still the one)
		<br />
    You're still the one that I love
		<br />
    The only one I dream of
		<br />
    You're still the one I kiss goodnight
		<br />
		<br />
    Ain't nothin' better
		<br />
    We beat the odds together
		<br />
    I'm glad we didn't listen
		<br />
    Look at what we would be missin'
		<br />
		<br />
    They said, "I bet they'll never make it"
		<br />
    But just look at us holding on
		<br />
    We're still together, still going strong
		<br />
		<br />
