    Sunshine go away today
		<br />
    I don't feel much like dancing
		<br />
    Some man's gone, he's tried to run my life
		<br />
    Don't know what he's asking
		<br />
		<br />
    He tells me I'd better get in line
		<br />
    Can't hear what he's saying
		<br />
    When I grow up, I'm going to make it mine
		<br />
    But these aren't dues I been paying
		<br />
		<br />
    How much does it cost, I'll buy it
		<br />
    The time is all we've lost, I'll try it
		<br />
    But he can't even run his own life
		<br />
    I'll be damned if he'll run mine, Sunshine

    Sunshine go away today
		<br />
    I don't feel much like dancing
		<br />
    Some man's gone, he's tried to run my life
		<br />
    Don't know what he's asking
		<br />
		<br />
    Working starts to make me wonder where
		<br />
    The fruits of what I do are going
		<br />
    He says in love and war all is fair
		<br />
    But he's got cards he ain't showing
		<br />
		<br />
    How much does it cost, I'll buy it
		<br />
    The time is all we've lost, I'll try it
		<br />
    And he can't even run his own life
		<br />
    I'll be damned if he'll run mine, Sunshine
		<br />
		<br />
    Sunshine come on back another day
		<br />
    I promise you I'll be singing
		<br />
    This old world, she's gonna turn around
		<br />
    Brand new bells'll be ringing
