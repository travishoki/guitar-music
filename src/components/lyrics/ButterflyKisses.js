    There's two things I know for sure
    <br />
    She was sent here from heaven
    <br />
    And she's daddy's little girl
    <br />
    As I drop to my knees by her bed at night
    <br />
    She talks to Jesus
    <br />
    And I close my eyes
    <br />
    And I thank God for all of the joy in my life
    <br />
    Oh, but most of all
    <br />
    <br />
    For butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer
    <br />
    Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair
    <br />
    "Walk beside the pony, Daddy, it's my first ride"
    <br />
    "I know the cake looks funny, Daddy, but I sure tried"
    <br />
    Oh, with all that I've done wrong
    <br />
    I must have done something right
    <br />
    To deserve a hug every morning
    <br />
    And butterfly kisses at night
    <br />
    <br />
    Sweet 16 today
    <br />
    She's looking like her mama
    <br />
    A little more everyday
    <br />
    One part woman
    <br />
    The other part girl
    <br />
    To perfume and make-up
    <br />
    From ribbons and curls
    <br />
    Trying her wings out in a great big world
    <br />
    But I remember
    <br />
    <br />
    Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer
    <br />
    Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair
    <br />
    "You know how much I love you, Daddy, but if you don't mind"
    <br />
    "I'm only gonna kiss you on the cheek this time"
    <br />
    Oh, with all that I've done wrong
    <br />
    I must have done something right
    <br />
    To deserve her love every morning
    <br />
    And butterfly kisses at night
    <br />
    <br />
    All the precious time
    <br />
    Ooh
    <br />
    Like the wind, the years go by
    <br />
    Precious butterfly
    <br />
    Spread your wings and fly
    <br />
    <br />
    She'll change her name today
    <br />
    She'll make a promise
    <br />
    And I'll give her away
    <br />
    Standing in the bride-room
    <br />
    Just staring at her
    <br />
    She asked me what I'm thinking
    <br />
    And I said, "I'm not sure"
    <br />
    "I just feel like I'm losing my baby girl"
    <br />
    And she leaned over
    <br />
    <br />
    Gave me butterfly kisses with her mama there
    <br />
    Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair
    <br />
    "Walk me down the aisle, Daddy, it's just about time"
    <br />
    "Does my wedding gown look pretty, Daddy?"
    <br />
    "Daddy, don't cry"
    <br />
    Oh, with all that I've done wrong
    <br />
    I must have done something right
    <br />
    To deserve her love every morning
    <br />
    And butterfly kisses
    <br />
    <br />
    I couldn't ask God for more
    <br />
    Man, this is what love is
    <br />
    I know I gotta let her go
    <br />
    But I'll always remember
    <br />
    Every hug in the morning
    <br />
    And butterfly kisses
    <br />
