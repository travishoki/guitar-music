		All my bags are packed,
		<br />
		I&apos;m ready to go,
		<br />
		I&apos;m standing here outside your door,
		<br />
		I hate to wake you up to say good-bye.
		<br />
		But the dawn is breaking,
		<br />
		it&apos;s early morn,
		<br />
		the taxi&apos;s waiting He&apos;s blowing his horn.
		<br />
		Already I&apos;m so lonesome I could cry.
		<br />
		<br />
		So kiss me and smile for me,
		<br />
		tell me that you&apos;ll wait for me,
		<br />
		hold me like you&apos;ll never let me go.
		<br />
		&apos;Cause I&apos;m leaving on a jet plane,
		<br />
		don&apos;t know when I&apos;ll be back again.
		<br />
		Oh, babe, I hate to go.
		<br />
		<br />
		There&apos;s so many times I&apos;ve let you down,
		<br />
		so many times I&apos;ve played around,
		<br />
		I tell you now they don&apos;t mean a thing.
		<br />
		Every place I go I&apos;ll think of you,
		<br />
		every song I sing I&apos;ll sing for you,
		<br />
		when I come back,
		<br />
		I&apos;ll bring your wedding ring.
		<br />
		<br />
		So kiss me and smile for me,
		<br />
		tell me that you&apos;ll wait for me,
		<br />
		hold me like you&apos;ll never let me go.
		<br />
		&apos;Cause I&apos;m leaving on a jet plane,
		<br />
		don&apos;t know when I&apos;ll be back again.
		<br />
		Oh, babe, I hate to go.
		<br />
		<br />
		Now the time has come to leave you,
		<br />
		one more time let me kiss you,
		<br />
		then close your eyes,
		<br />
		I&apos;ll be on my way.
		<br />
		Dream about the days to come when I won&apos;t have to leave alone,
		<br />
		about the times I won&apos;t have to say:
		<br />
		<br />
		So kiss me and smile for me,
		<br />
		tell me that you&apos;ll wait for me,
		<br />
		hold me like you&apos;ll never let me go.
		<br />
		&apos;Cause I&apos;m leaving on a jet plane,
		<br />
		don&apos;t know when I&apos;ll be back again.
		<br />
		Oh, babe, I hate to go.
