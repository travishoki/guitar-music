    Morning has broken, like the first morning<br/>
    Blackbird has spoken, like the first bird<br/>
    Praise for the singing, praise for the morning<br/>
    Praise for them springing fresh from the word<br/>
    <br/>
    Sweet the rain&apos;s new fall, sunlit from heaven<br/>
    Like the first dew fall, on the first grass<br/>
    Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden<br/>
    Sprung in completeness where his feet pass<br/>
    <br/>
    Mine is the sunlight, mine is the morning<br/>
    Born of the one light, Eden saw play<br/>
    Praise with elation, praise every morning<br/>
    God&apos;s re-creation of the new day<br/>
    <br/>
    Morning has broken, like the first morning<br/>
    Blackbird has spoken, like the first bird<br/>
    Praise for the singing, praise for the morning<br/>
    Praise for them springing fresh from the word
    </div>
