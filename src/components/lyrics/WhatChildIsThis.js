    What child is this, who, laid to rest, on Mary&apos;s lap, is sleeping?<br/>
    Whom angels greet with anthems sweet, while shepherds watch are keeping?<br/>
    This, this is Christ the King, whom shepherds guard and angels sing:<br/>
    Haste, haste to bring him laud, the Babe, the Son of Mary!<br/>
    <br/>
    So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh, come peasant, king to own Him,<br/>
    The King of kings, salvation brings, let loving hearts enthrone Him.<br/>
    Raise, raise the song on high, the Virgin sings her lullaby:<br/>
    Joy, joy, for Christ is born, the Babe, the Son of Mary!<br/>
