    Almost heaven, West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.<br/>
    Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze.<br/>
    <br/>
    Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.<br/>
    West Virginia, mountain mamma, take me home, country roads.<br/>
    <br/>
    All my memories gather round her, miner&apos;s lady, stranger to blue water.<br/>
    Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.<br/>
    <br/>
    Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.<br/>
    West Virginia, mountain mamma, take me home, country roads.<br/>
    <br/>
    I hear her voice in the morning hour, she calls me, the radio reminds me of my home far away.<br/>
    And driving down the road I get a feeling that I should have been home yesterday, yesterday.<br/>
    <br/>
    Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.<br/>
    West Virginia, mountain mamma, take me home, country roads.<br/>
    <br/>
    Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.<br/>
    West Virginia, mountain mamma, take me home, country roads<br/>
    <br/>
    Take me home now, country roads,<br/>
    Take me home now, country roads.
