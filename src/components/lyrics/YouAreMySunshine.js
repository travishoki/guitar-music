    The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping
    <br />
    I dreamed I held you in my arms
    <br />
    When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
    <br />
    And I hung my head and cried
    <br />
    <br />
    You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
    <br />
    You make me happy when skies are grey
    <br />
    You&apos;ll never know, dear, how much I love you
    <br />
    Please don&apos;t take my sunshine away
    <br />
    <br />
    I&apos;ll always love you and make you happy
    <br />
    If you will only say the same
    <br />
    But if you leave me to love another
    <br />
    You&apos;ll regret it all some day
    <br />
    <br />
    You told me once, dear, you really loved me
    <br />
    And no one else could come between
    <br />
    But now you&apos;ve left me and love another
    <br />
    You have shattered all my dreams
