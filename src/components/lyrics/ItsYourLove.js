    Yeah, yeah, yeah, mmhmm
		<br />
		<br />
    Dancing in the dark
		<br />
    Middle of the night
		<br />
    Taking your heart
		<br />
    And holding it tight
		<br />
    Emotional touch
		<br />
    Touching my skin
		<br />
    And askin' you to do
		<br />
    What you've been doing
		<br />
    All over again
		<br />
		<br />
    Oh, it's a beautiful thing
		<br />
    Don't think I can keep it all in
		<br />
    I just gotta let you know
		<br />
    What it is that won't let me go
		<br />
		<br />
    It's your love
		<br />
    It just does something to me
		<br />
    It sends a shock right through me
		<br />
    I can't get enough
		<br />
    And if you wonder
		<br />
    About the spell I'm under
		<br />
    Oh it's your love
		<br />
		<br />
    Better than I was
		<br />
    More than I am
		<br />
    And all of this happened
		<br />
    By taking your hand
		<br />
    And who I am now
		<br />
    Is who I wanted to be
		<br />
    And now that we're together
		<br />
    I'm stronger than ever, I'm happy and free
		<br />
		<br />
    Oh, it's a beautiful thing
		<br />
    Don't think I can keep it all in (oh oh)
		<br />
    And if you ask me why I've changed
		<br />
    All I gotta do is say your sweet name
		<br />
		<br />
    It's your love
		<br />
    It just does something to me
		<br />
    It sends a shock right through me
		<br />
