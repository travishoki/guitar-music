		See the stone set in your eyes
		<br />
		See the thorn twist in your side
		<br />
		I&apos;ll wait for you
		<br />
		Sleight of hand and twist of fate
		<br />
		On a bed of nails, she makes me wait
		<br />
		And I wait without you
		<br />
		<br />
		With or without you
		<br />
		With or without you
		<br />
		<br />
		Through the storm, we reach the shore
		<br />
		You give it all but I want more
		<br />
		And I&apos;m waiting for you
		<br />
		<br />
		With or without you
		<br />
		With or without you, ah, ah
		<br />
		I can&apos;t live
		<br />
		With or without you
		<br />
		<br />
		And you give yourself away
		<br />
		And you give yourself away
		<br />
		And you give
		<br />
		And you give
		<br />
		And you give yourself away
		<br />
		<br />
		My hands are tied
		<br />
		My body bruised, she got me with
		<br />
		Nothing to win and
		<br />
		Nothing left to lose
		<br />
		<br />
		And you give yourself away
		<br />
		And you give yourself away
		<br />
		And you give
		<br />
		And you give
		<br />
		And you give yourself away
		<br />
		<br />
		With or without you
		<br />
		With or without you, oh
		<br />
		I can&apos;t live

		With or without you

		Oh, oh
		<br />
		Oh, oh
		<br />
