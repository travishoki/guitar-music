    Listen children to a story
    <br />
    That was written long ago
    <br />
    About a kingdom, on a mountain
    <br />
    And the valley folk below
    <br />
    On the mountain was a treasure
    <br />
    Burred deep beneath a stone
    <br />
    And the valley people swore
    <br />
    Theyd have it for their very own
    <br />
    <br />
    Go ahead and hate your neighbor
    <br />
    Go ahead and cheat a friend
    <br />
    Do it in the name of Heaven
    <br />
    You can justify it in the end
    <br />
    There wont be any trumpets blowing
    <br />
    Come the judgement day
    <br />
    On the bloody morning after... <br />
    One tin soldier rides away
    <br />
    <br />
    So the people of the valley
    <br />
    Sent a message up the hill
    <br />
    Asking for the buried treasure
    <br />
    Tons of gold for which they&apos;d kill
    <br />
    Came an answer from the kingdom
    <br />
    With our brothers we will share
    <br />
    All the secrets of our mountain
    <br />
    All the riches buried there
    <br />
    <br />
    Now the valley cried in anger
    <br />
    Mount your horses
    <br />
    Draw your sword
    <br />
    And they killed the mountain people
    <br />
    Sure they&apos;d won their just reward
    <br />
    Now they stood beside the treasure
    <br />
    On the mountain dark and red
    <br />
    Turned the stone and looked beneath it
    <br />
    Peace on Earth
    <br />
    Was all it said
    <br />
    <br />
    Go ahead and hate your neighbor
    <br />
    Go ahead and cheat a friend
    <br />
    Do it in the name of Heaven
    <br />
    You can justify it in the end
    <br />
    There wont be any trumpets blowing
    <br />
    Come the judgement day
    <br />
    On the bloody morning after... <br />
    One tin soldier rides away
    <br />
    <br />
    Go ahead and hate your neighbor
    <br />
    Go ahead and cheat a friend
    <br />
    Do it in the name of Heaven
    <br />
    You can justify it in the end
    <br />
    There wont be any trumpets blowing
    <br />
    Come the judgement day
    <br />
    On the bloody morning after... <br />
    One tin soldier rides away
