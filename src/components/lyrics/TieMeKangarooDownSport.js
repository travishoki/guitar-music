    There&apos;s an old Australian stockman lying, dying. He gets himself up
    <br />
    onto one elbow and &apos;e turns to his mates, who are all gathered around
    and &apos;e says:
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Watch me wallabies feed, mate
    <br />
    Watch me wallabies feed,
    <br />
    They&apos;re a dangerous breed, mate
    <br />
    So watch me wallabies feed
    <br />
    Altogether now!
    <br />
    <br />

    <br />
    Tie me kangaroo down, sport
    <br />
