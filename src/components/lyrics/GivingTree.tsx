	<p>
		All the leaves on the giving tree have fallen
		<br />
		No shade to crawl in underneath
		<br />
		I got scars from a pocket knife
		<br />
		Where you carved your heart into me
		<br />
		<br />
		If all you wanted was love
		<br />
		Why would you use me up
		<br />
		Cut me down, build a boat, and sail away
		<br />
		When all I wanted to be was your giving tree
		<br />
		Settle down, build a home, and make you happy?
		<br />
		<br />
		I lie in the dead of night and I wonder
		<br />
		Whose covers you&apos;re between
		<br />
		And it&apos;s sad laying in his bed
		<br />
		You feel hollow, so you crawl home back to me
		<br />
		<br />
		If all you wanted was love
		<br />
		Why would you use me up
		<br />
		Cut me down, build a boat, and sail away
		<br />
		When all I wanted to be was your giving tree
		<br />
		Settle down, build a home, and make you happy?
		<br />
		<br />
		Well, I see a trail that starts
		<br />
		A line of broken hearts behind you
		<br />
		That lead you back to me
		<br />
		The once sad and lonely fool
		<br />
		With nothing left but roots to show, oh
		<br />
		<br />
		If all you wanted was love
		<br />
		Why would you use me up
		<br />
		Cut me down, build a boat, and sail away
		<br />
		When all I wanted to be was your giving tree
		<br />
		Settle down, build a home, and make you happy?
		<br />
		Settle down, build a home, and make you happy?
