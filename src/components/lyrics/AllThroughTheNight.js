    Sleep, my child, and peace attend thee
    <br />
    All through the night
    <br />
    Guardian angels God will send thee
    <br />
    All through the night
    <br />
    Soft the drowsy hours are creeping
    <br />
    Hill and dale in slumber sleeping
    <br />
    I my loving vigil keeping
    <br />
    All through the night
    <br />
    While the moon her watch is keeping
    <br />
    All through the night
    <br />
    While the weary world is sleeping
    <br />
    All through the night
    <br />
    Over thy spirit gently stealing
    <br />
    Visions of delight revealing
    <br />
    Breathes a pure and holy feeling
    <br />
    All through the night
    <br />
    Hmmmm
    <br />
    All through the night
    <br />
    Hmmmm
    <br />
    All through the night
    <br />
    Through your dreams you&apos;re softly stealing
    <br />
    Visions of delight revealing
    <br />
    Christmas time is so appealing
    <br />
    All through the night
    <br />
    All through the night All through the night
