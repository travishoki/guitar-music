		Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea
		<br />
		And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honali
		<br />
		Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff
		<br />
		And brought him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff
		<br />
		<br />
		Oh, Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea
		<br />
		And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honali
		<br />
		Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea
		<br />
		And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honali
		<br />
		<br />
		Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail
		<br />
		Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff&apos;s gigantic tail
		<br />
		Noble kings and princes would bow whene&apos;er they came
		<br />
		Pirate ships would lower their flags when Puff roared out his name
		<br />
		<br />
		Oh, Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea
		<br />
		And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honali

		<br />
		<br />
		A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys
		<br />
		Painted wings and giant&apos;s rings make way for other toys
		<br />
		One gray night it happened, Jackie Paper came no more
		<br />
		And Puff, that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar
		<br />
		<br />
		His head was bent in sorrow, green scales fell like rain
		<br />
		Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane
		<br />
		Without his lifelong friend, Puff could not be brave
		<br />
		So Puff, that mighty dragon, sadly slipped into his cave
		<br />
		<br />
		Oh, Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea
		<br />
		And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honali
		<br />
		Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea
