		When the rain is blowing in your face
		<br />
		And the whole world is on your case
		<br />
		I could offer you a warm embrace
		<br />
		To make you feel my love
		<br />
		<br />
		When the evening shadows and the stars appear
		<br />
		And there is no one there to dry your tears
		<br />
		I could hold you for a million years
		<br />
		To make you feel my love
		<br />
		<br />
		I know you haven&apos;t made your mind up yet
		<br />
		But I will never do you wrong
		<br />
		I&apos;ve known it from the moment that we met
		<br />
		No doubt in my mind where you belong
		<br />
		<br />
		I&apos;d go hungry, I&apos;d go black and blue
		<br />
		I&apos;d go crawling down the avenue
		<br />
		No, there&apos;s nothing that I wouldn&apos;t do
		<br />
		To make you feel my love
		<br />
		<br />
		The storms are raging on the rolling sea
		<br />
		And on the highway of regret
		<br />
		The winds of change are blowing wild and free
		<br />
		You ain&apos;t seen nothing like me yet
		<br />
		<br />
		I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
		<br />
		Nothing that I wouldn&apos;t do
		<br />
		Go to the ends of the Earth for you
		<br />
		To make you feel my love
		<br />
		To make you feel my love
