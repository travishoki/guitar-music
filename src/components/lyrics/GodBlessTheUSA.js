    If tomorrow all the things were gone I&apos;d worked for all my life<br/>
    And I had to start again with just my children and my wife<br/>
    I&apos;d thank my lucky stars to be livin&apos; here today<br/>
    &apos;Cause the flag still stands for freedom and they can&apos;t take that away<br/>
    <br/>
    And I&apos;m proud to be an American where at least I know I&apos;m free<br/>
    And I won&apos;t forget the men who died, who gave that right to me<br/>
    And I&apos;d gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today<br/>
    &apos;Cause there ain&apos;t no doubt I love this land<br/>
    God bless the USA<br/>
    <br/>
    From the lakes of Minnesota, to the hills of Tennessee<br/>
    Across the plains of Texas, from sea to shining sea<br/>
    From Detroit down to Houston and New York to LA<br/>
    Well, there&apos;s pride in every American heart<br/>
    And it&apos;s time we stand and say that<br/>
    <br/>
    <i>[2x]</i><br/>
    I&apos;m proud to be an American where at least I know I&apos;m free<br/>
    And I won&apos;t forget the men who died, who gave that right to me<br/>
    And I&apos;d gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today<br/>
    &apos;Cause there ain&apos;t no doubt I love this land<br/>
    God bless the USA
