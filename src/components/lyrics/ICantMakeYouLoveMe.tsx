		Turn down the lights
		<br />
		Turn down the bed
		<br />
		Turn down these voices inside my head
		<br />
		Lay down with me
		<br />
		Tell me no lies
		<br />
		Just hold me close, don&apos;t patronize
		<br />
		Don&apos;t patronize me
		<br />
		<br />
		&apos;Cause I can&apos;t make you love me if you don&apos;t
		<br />
		You can&apos;t make your heart feel something it won&apos;t
		<br />
		Here in the dark, in these final hours
		<br />
		I will lay down my heart and I&apos;ll feel the power
		<br />
		But you won&apos;t, no you won&apos;t
		<br />
		&apos;Cause I can&apos;t make you love me, if you don&apos;t
		<br />
		<br />
		I&apos;ll close my eyes, then I won&apos;t see
		<br />
		The love you don&apos;t feel when you&apos;re holding me
		<br />
		Morning will come and I&apos;ll do what&apos;s right
		<br />
		Just give me till then to give up this fight
		<br />
		And I will give up this fight
		<br />
		<br />
		&apos;Cause I can&apos;t make you love me if you don&apos;t
		<br />
		You can&apos;t make your heart feel something it won&apos;t
		<br />
		Here in the dark, in these final hours
		<br />
		I will lay down my heart and I&apos;ll feel the power
		<br />
		But you won&apos;t, no you won&apos;t
		<br />
		&apos;Cause I can&apos;t make you love me, if you don&apos;t
