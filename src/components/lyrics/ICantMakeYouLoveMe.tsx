	<div>
    Turn down the lights
		<br />
    Turn down the bed
		<br />
    Turn down these voices inside my head
		<br />
    Lay down with me
		<br />
    Tell me no lies
		<br />
    Just hold me close, don't patronize
		<br />
    Don't patronize me
		<br />
		<br />
    'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
		<br />
    You can't make your heart feel something it won't
		<br />
    Here in the dark, in these final hours
		<br />
    I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
		<br />
    But you won't, no you won't
		<br />
    'Cause I can't make you love me, if you don't
		<br />
		<br />
    I'll close my eyes, then I won't see
		<br />
    The love you don't feel when you're holding me
		<br />
    Morning will come and I'll do what's right
		<br />
    Just give me till then to give up this fight
		<br />
    And I will give up this fight
		<br />
		<br />
    'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
		<br />
    You can't make your heart feel something it won't
		<br />
    Here in the dark, in these final hours
		<br />
    I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
		<br />
    But you won't, no you won't
		<br />
    'Cause I can't make you love me, if you don't
