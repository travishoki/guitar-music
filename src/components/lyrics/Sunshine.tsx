		Sunshine go away today
		<br />
		I don&apos;t feel much like dancing
		<br />
		Some man&apos;s gone, he&apos;s tried to run my life
		<br />
		Don&apos;t know what he&apos;s asking
		<br />
		<br />
		He tells me I&apos;d better get in line
		<br />
		Can&apos;t hear what he&apos;s saying
		<br />
		When I grow up, I&apos;m going to make it mine
		<br />
		But these aren&apos;t dues I been paying
		<br />
		<br />
		How much does it cost, I&apos;ll buy it
		<br />
		The time is all we&apos;ve lost, I&apos;ll try it
		<br />
		But he can&apos;t even run his own life
		<br />
		I&apos;ll be damned if he&apos;ll run mine, Sunshine

		Sunshine go away today
		<br />
		I don&apos;t feel much like dancing
		<br />
		Some man&apos;s gone, he&apos;s tried to run my life
		<br />
		Don&apos;t know what he&apos;s asking
		<br />
		<br />
		Working starts to make me wonder where
		<br />
		The fruits of what I do are going
		<br />
		He says in love and war all is fair
		<br />
		But he&apos;s got cards he ain&apos;t showing
		<br />
		<br />
		How much does it cost, I&apos;ll buy it
		<br />
		The time is all we&apos;ve lost, I&apos;ll try it
		<br />
		And he can&apos;t even run his own life
		<br />
		I&apos;ll be damned if he&apos;ll run mine, Sunshine
		<br />
		<br />
		Sunshine come on back another day
		<br />
		I promise you I&apos;ll be singing
		<br />
		This old world, she&apos;s gonna turn around
		<br />
		Brand new bells&apos;ll be ringing
