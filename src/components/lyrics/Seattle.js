    <div>
    The bluest skies you&apos;ve ever seen are in Seattle<br/>
    And the hills the greenest green in Seattle<br/>
    Like a beautiful child, growing up free and wild<br/>
    Full of hopes and full of fears, full of laughter, full of tears<br/>
    Full of dreams to last the years in Seattle<br/>
    In Seattle<br/>
    <br/>
    When it&apos;s time to leave your home and your loved ones<br/>
    It&apos;s the hardest thing a boy can ever do<br/>
    And you pray that you will find someone warm and sweet and kind<br/>
    But you&apos;re not sure what&apos;s waiting there for you<br/>
    <br/>
    The bluest skies you&apos;ve ever seen are in Seattle<br/>
    And the hills the greenest green in Seattle<br/>
    Like a beautiful child, growing up free and wild<br/>
    Full of hopes and full of fears, full of laughter, full of tears<br/>
    Full of dreams to last the years in Seattle<br/>
    In Seattle<br/>
    <br/>
    When you find your own true love, you will know it<br/>
    By her smile, by the look in her eye<br/>
    Scent of pine trees in the air, never knew a day so fair<br/>
    It makes you feel so proud that you could cry
    </div>
