		Almost heaven, West Virginia,
		<br />
		Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
		<br />
		Life is old there, older than the trees,
		<br />
		Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze.
		<br />
		<br />
		Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.
		<br />
		West Virginia, mountain mamma,
		<br />
		Take me home, country roads.
		<br />
		<br />
		All my memories gather round her,
		<br />
		Miner&apos;s lady, stranger to blue water.
		<br />
		Dark and dusty, painted on the sky,
		<br />
		Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.
		<br />
		<br />
		Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.
		<br />
		West Virginia, mountain mamma,
		<br />
		Take me home, country roads.
		<br />
		<br />
		I hear her voice in the morning hour, she calls me,
		<br />
		The radio reminds me of my home far away.
		<br />
		And driving down the road I get a feeling that I should have been home
		yesterday, yesterday.
		<br />
		<br />
		Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.
		<br />
		West Virginia, mountain mamma,
		<br />
		Take me home, country roads.
		<br />
		<br />
		Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.
		<br />
		West Virginia, mountain mamma,
		<br />
		Take me home, country roads
		<br />
		<br />
		Take me home now, country roads,
		<br />
		Take me home now, country roads.
