	<p>
		Christopher Robin and I walked along
		<br />
		Under branches lit up by the moon
		<br />
		Posing our questions to Owl and Eeyore
		<br />
		As our days disappeared all too soon
		<br />
		But I&apos;ve wandered much further today than I should
		<br />
		And I can&apos;t seem to find my way back to the wood
		<br />
		<br />
		So help me if you can, I&apos;ve got to get
		<br />
		Back to the house at Pooh corner by one
		<br />
		You&apos;d be surprised there&apos;s so much to be done
		<br />
		Count all the bees in the hive
		<br />
		Chase all the clouds from the sky (chase the clouds from above)
		<br />
		Back to the days of Christopher Robin and Pooh
		<br />
		<br />
		Winnie the Pooh doesn&apos;t know what to do
		<br />
		Got a honey jar stuck on his nose
		<br />
		He came to me asking help and advice
		<br />
		And from there no one knows where he goes
		<br />
		So I sent him to ask of the owl if he&apos;s there
		<br />
		How to loosen a jar from the nose of a bear
		<br />
		<br />
		So help me if you can I&apos;ve got to get
		<br />
		Back to the house at Pooh corner by one
		<br />
		You&apos;d be surprised there&apos;s so much to be done
		<br />
		Count all the bees in the hive
		<br />
		Chase all the clouds from the sky (chase the clouds from above)
		<br />
		Back to the days of Christopher Robin and Pooh
		<br />
		<br />
		Back to the days of Christopher Robin (back to days)
		<br />
		Back to the ways of Christopher Robin (back to the ways)
		<br />
		Back to the days of Pooh
