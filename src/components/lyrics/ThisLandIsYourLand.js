    This land is your land, this land is my land,
    <br />
    From California, to the New York Island,
    <br />
    From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream Waters,
    <br />
    This land was made for you and me. <br />
    <br />
    I roamed and rambled, and I followed my footsteps
    <br />
    To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
    <br />
    And all around me a voice was singing
    <br />
    This land was made for you and me! <br />
    <br />
    This land is your land, this land is my land,
    <br />
    From California, to the New York Island,
    <br />
    From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream Waters,
    <br />
    This land was made for you and me. <br />
    <br />
    As I went walking that ribbon of highway
    <br />
    I saw above me that endless skyway
    <br />
    I saw below me those golden valleys
    <br />
    This land was made for you and me! <br />
    <br />
    This land is your land, this land is my land,
    <br />
    From California, to the New York Island,
    <br />
    From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream Waters,
    <br />
    This land was made for you and me. <br />
    <br />
    As the sun was shining, and I was strolling,
    <br />
    And the wheat fields waving, and the dust clouds rolling,
    <br />
    As the fog was lifting, a voice was saying
    <br />
    "This land was made for you and me!" <br />
    <br />
    This land is your land, this land is my land,
    <br />
    From California, to the New York Island,
    <br />
    From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream Waters,
    <br />
    This land was made for you and me.
