    Oh beautiful, for heroes proved,
    <br />
    In liberating strife,
    <br />
    Who more than self, our country loved,
    <br />
    And mercy more than life,
    <br />
    America, America, may God thy gold refine,
    <br />
    Till all success be nobleness
    <br />
    And every gain devined.
    <br />
    And you know when I was in school,
    <br />
    We used to sing it something like this, listen here:
    <br />
    Oh beautiful, for spacious skies,
    <br />
    For amber waves of grain,
    <br />
    For purple mountain majesties,
    <br />
    Above the fruited plain,
    <br />
    But now wait a minute, I&apos;m talking about
    <br />
    America, sweet America,
    <br />
    You know, God done shed his grace on thee,
    <br />
    He crowned thy good, yes he did, in a brotherhood,
    <br />
    From sea to shining sea.
    <br />
    You know, I wish I had somebody to help me sing this
    <br />
    (America, America, God shed his grace on thee)
    <br />
    America, I love you America, you see,
    <br />
    My God he done shed his grace on thee,
    <br />
    And you oughta love him for it,
    <br />
    Cause he, he, he, he, crowned thy good,
    <br />
    He told me he would, with brotherhood,
    <br />
    (From sea to shining sea).
    <br />
    Oh Lord, oh Lord, I thank you Lord
    <br />
    (Shining sea).
