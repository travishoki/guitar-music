    In the town where I was born<br/>
    Lived a man who sailed to sea<br/>
    And he told us of his life<br/>
    In the land of submarines<br/>
    <br/>
    So we sailed up to the sun<br/>
    Till we found the sea of green<br/>
    And we lived beneath the waves<br/>
    In our yellow submarine<br/>
    <br/>
    We all live in a yellow submarine<br/>
    Yellow submarine, yellow submarine<br/>
    We all live in a yellow submarine<br/>
    Yellow submarine, yellow submarine<br/>
    <br/>
    And our friends are all on board<br/>
    Many more of them live next door<br/>
    And the band begins to play<br/>
    <br/>
    We all live in a yellow submarine<br/>
    Yellow submarine, yellow submarine<br/>
    We all live in a yellow submarine<br/>
    Yellow submarine, yellow submarine<br/>
    <br/>
    As we live a life of ease<br/>
    Everyone of us has all we need<br/>
    Sky of blue and sea of green<br/>
    In our yellow submarine<br/>
    <br/>
    We all live in a yellow submarine<br/>
    Yellow submarine, yellow submarine<br/>
    We all live in a yellow submarine<br/>
    Yellow submarine, yellow submarine<br/>
    We all live in a yellow submarine<br/>
    Yellow submarine, yellow submarine<br/>
    We all live in a yellow submarine<br/>
    Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
