		Would you know my name?

		Would you help me stand?
		<br />
		If I saw you in heaven
		<br />
		<br />
		I&apos;ll find my way
		<br />
		Through night and day
		<br />
		&apos;Cause I know I just can&apos;t stay
		<br />
		Here in heaven
		<br />
		<br />
		Time can bring you down
		<br />
		Time can bend your knees
		<br />
		Time can break your heart
		<br />
		Have you begging please
		<br />
		Begging please
		<br />
		<br />
		Beyond the door
		<br />
		There&apos;s peace, I&apos;m sure
		<br />
		And I know there&apos;ll be no more
		<br />
		Tears in heaven
		<br />
		<br />
		Would you know my name?
		<br />
		If I saw you in heaven
		<br />
		Would you be the same?
		<br />
		If I saw you in heaven
		<br />
		<br />
		I must be strong
		<br />
		And carry on
