    A time to be born, a time to die

    A time to plant, a time to reap

    A time to kill, a time to heal

    A time to laugh, a time to weep

    A time to build up, a time to break down
		<br />
    A time to dance, a time to mourn
		<br />
    A time to cast away stones
		<br />
    A time to gather stones together
		<br />

    And a time to every purpose under heaven

		<br />
    A time of love, a time of hate
		<br />
    A time of war, a time of peace
		<br />
    A time you may embrace
		<br />
    A time to refrain from embracing
		<br />

    To everything - turn, turn, turn

    There is a season - turn, turn, turn
		<br />
    And a time to every purpose under heaven
		<br />
		<br />
    A time to gain, a time to lose
		<br />
    A time to rend, a time to sew
		<br />
    A time for love, a time for hate
		<br />A time for peace, I swear it&apos;s not too late!
