    Somewhere over the rainbow
    <br />
    Way up high
    <br />
    And the dreams that you dreamed of
    <br />
    Once in a lullaby
    <br />
    <br />
    Somewhere over the rainbow
    <br />
    Blue birds fly
    <br />
    And the dreams that you dreamed of
    <br />
    Dreams really do come true ooh oh
    <br />
    <br />
    Someday I&apos;ll wish upon a star
    <br />
    Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
    <br />
    Where trouble melts like lemon drops
    <br />
    High above the chimney top
    <br />
    That&apos;s where you&apos;ll find me
    <br />
    <br />
    Oh, somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly
    <br />
    And the dream that you dare to,
    <br />
    Oh why, oh why can&apos;t I?
    <br />
    <br />
    Well I see trees of green and red roses too,
    <br />
    I&apos;ll watch them bloom for me and you
    <br />
    And I think to myself
    <br />
    What a wonderful world
    <br />
    <br />
    Well I see skies of blue
    <br />
    And I see clouds of white
    <br />
    And the brightness of day
    <br />
    I like the dark
    <br />
    And I think to myself
    <br />
    What a wonderful world
    <br />
    <br />
    The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
    <br />
    Are also on the faces of people passing by
    <br />
    I see friends shaking hands
    <br />
    Singing, "How do you do?"
    <br />
    They&apos;re really singing, "I...I love you."
    <br />
    <br />
    I hear babies cry and I watch them grow,
    <br />
    They&apos;ll learn much more than we&apos;ll know
    <br />
    And I think to myself
    <br />
    What a wonderful world world
    <br />
    <br />
    Someday I&apos;ll wish upon a star,
    <br />
    Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
    <br />
    Where trouble melts like lemon drops
    <br />
    High above the chimney top
    <br />
    That&apos;s where you&apos;ll find me
    <br />
    <br />
    Oh, somewhere over the rainbow way up high
    <br />
    And the dream that you dare to, why, oh why can&apos;t I? I?
