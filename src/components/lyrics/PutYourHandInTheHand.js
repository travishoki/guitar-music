    <div>
    Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water<br/>
    Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea<br/>
    Take a look at yourself and you can look at others differently<br/>
    By putting your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee<br/>
    <br/>
    Every time I look into the holy book I wanna tremble<br/>
    When I read about the part where the carpenter cleared the temple<br/>
    For the buyers and the sellers were no different fellers than what I profess to be<br/>
    And it causes me shame to know I&apos;m not the gal that I should be<br/>
    <br/>
    Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water<br/>
    Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea<br/>
    Take a look at yourself and you can look at others differently<br/>
    By putting your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee<br/>
    <br/>
    Momma taught me how to pray before I reached the age of seven<br/>
    When I&apos;m down on my knees, that&apos;s when I&apos;m close to heaven<br/>
    Daddy lived his life with two kids and a wife; you do what you must do<br/>
    But he showed me enough of what it takes to get you through<br/>
    <br/>
    Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water<br/>
    Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea<br/>
    Take a look at yourself and you can look at others differently<br/>
    By putting your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee
