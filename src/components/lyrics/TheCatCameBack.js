    Old Mr. Johnson had troubles of his own <br/>
    He had a yellow cat that wouldn&apos;t leave his home <br/>
    He tried and he tried to give the cat away <br/>
    He gave it to a man going far far away <br/>
    <br/>
    But the cat came back, the very next day <br/>
    The cat came back <br/>
    (they thought he was a goner) <br/>
    but the cat came back, he just couldn&apos;t stay <br/>
    Away away away <br/>
    MEOW! <br/>
    <br/>
    So he gave it to a woman going <br/>
    Up in a balloon <br/>
    He told her for to take it to the <br/>
    Man up in the moon <br/>
    The balloon came down about <br/>
    90 miles away <br/>
    and where the woman is now, <br/>
    well I cannot say <br/>
    <br/>
    but the cat came back… <br/>
    <br/>
    so he gave it to a man going way out West <br/>
    he told him for to take it to the one he loved the best <br/>
    first the train hit the track, <br/>
    then it jumped the rail <br/>
    and nobody was left to tell the awful tale <br/>
    <br/>
    But the cat came back…</p>
