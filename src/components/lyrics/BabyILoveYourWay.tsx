		Shadows grow so long before my eyes
		<br />
		And they&apos;re moving across the page
		<br />
		Suddenly the day turns into night
		<br />
		Far away from the city
		<br />
		Don&apos;t hesitate
		<br />
		&apos;Cause your love won&apos;t wait
		<br />
		<br />
		Oh baby I love your way, everyday
		<br />
		Wanna tell you I love your way, everyday
		<br />
		Wanna be with you night and day
		<br />
		<br />
		Moon appears to shine and light the sky
		<br />
		With the help of some firefly
		<br />
		Wonder how they have the power to shine, shine, shine
		<br />
		I can see them under the pine
		<br />
		Don&apos;t hesitate
		<br />
		&apos;Cause your love won&apos;t wait
		<br />
		<br />
		Oh baby I love your way, everyday
		<br />
		Wanna tell you I love your way, oh
		<br />
		Wanna be with you night and day, oh yeah
		<br />
		<br />
		Well don&apos;t hesitate
		<br />
		&apos;Cause your love won&apos;t wait
		<br />
		<br />
		I can see the sunset in your eyes
		<br />
		Brown and gray, blue besides
		<br />
		Clouds are stalking islands in the sun
		<br />
		I wish I could buy one
		<br />
		Out of season
		<br />
		<br />
		Don&apos;t hesitate
		<br />
		&apos;Cause your love won&apos;t wait
		<br />
		<br />
		Oh baby I love your way, everyday
		<br />
		Wanna tell you I love your way
		<br />
		Wanna be with you night and day
		<br />
		<br />
		Oh baby I love your way, everyday
		<br />
		Wanna tell you I love your way
		<br />
		Wanna be with you night and day, yeah
